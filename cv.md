##Summary
    Still from the average school (10 class) my wish was be become programmer, but was't opportunity reilize it. It had apeared only on begining of my second course in university. The most funny from past learning, that erlier i was trying  write code on sheets and write vocabluary for html, css, js, but without practic my knowledge had been loseing. Now i'm contining self education. My wish is a getting the great job that connecting with arts, mind work and selfreilizing, where hasn't border to self education. Web development is that way. Also I want to communicate with foreigners and therefore, beside learning programming, i'm learning 2 languages in parallel. I think that people should't working only on his place, but studying on it and take deep in it, or ocupy most range of scope. I think, the best phrase, for me, that stopped in my mind from teacher by physic in school, is "Peoples who's don't studing, stoping in one place - degrading. Who's Studing - evolving. Interval value don't exist".
