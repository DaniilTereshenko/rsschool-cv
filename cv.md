##Summary
    Still from the higher school (10 class) my wish was been become programer but was't opportunity reilize it. It had apeared only on my begining second course in university. The most funny is that erlyer i was trying a write the code on sheets and writing vocabluary for html, css, js, but without practice i had forgot it, but i continue self studing. My wish is a getting the great job that connecting with arts, mind work and selfreilizing, where hasn't border to self education. Web development is that way. Also I want to communicate with foreigners and therefore, beside learning programming, i learn 2 languages parallel. I think that people should't working only on his place but studying on it and take deep in it or ocupy most range of his working. I think, the best phrase, for me, which stopped in my mind from teacher by physic in school, is "Peoples who's don't studing, stoping in one place - degrading. Who's Studing - evolving. Interval value don't exist".
